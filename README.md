This website documents the places I have been to conduct my photo-taking adventures in the beautiful NParks in Singapore. I have included citizen surveys I have done using iNaturalist of the mammals and birds I have done.

This is what have collected in my profile in iNaturalist, a mobile app used recording an encounter with an individual organism at a particular time and location, so far from 2024 to 2025. I have collected 68 observations of 48 species of wildlife anamals and birds.

To understand the data, we found that there are many observations of the long tail macaques in the database of iNaturalist app. There is a strong correlation between the best months to visit Singapore, which is between February and March, between June and August, which is the dry and sunny weather in Singapore, perfect for taking long walks in the NParks to look for wildlife.
